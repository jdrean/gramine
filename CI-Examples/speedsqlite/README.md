# Speedtest1

I generated the binary by downloading the source code for sqlite and following the build process with `--enable-all` as recommended.

The source for sqlite can be downloaded here:

```
https://www.sqlite.org/src/zip/sqlite.zip
```

And we have a local copy of the version we used:

```
3.47.0 2024-10-03 16:31:08 825f01d7e258ac7981f715fd10708560381b079f0e026abc414cf56d16d862da (64-bit)
```
